# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ this is javi
### If you are a recruiter and ended up here, please, take a look!

Currently I'm learning everything that expands my JavaScript fundamentals and React best practices and implementations.
The _archived_ projects are just a part of my learning steps. I'm gonna tell you a story that might ring a bell. 
```js
const keep_trying : boolean = () => new_project && learning && fun && interesting    // true
 
for (let i = discover tech, i <= trully understand it, i+-+-+-+) {
      console.log('learning is not a linear process, you dummie')
      chaos_is_high = ecosystem === 'javascript' 
      
      // your big amount of conditionals that easily make
      // keep_trying return false. But it doesn't matter
      // cause I'm me, and I'll keep trying until I get it

}

keep_trying() 
  ? archive_and_make_new_project_cause('I know how to use it better') 
  : archive_and_make_new_project_cause('I'd rather use another tech')

```
